Choe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI view myself as an applied economist with interest\nin environmental economics and a particular focus on\nclimate change. Methodologically, I make use of\neconometric/machine learning methods and data science\ntools to conduct empirical analysis. I also use computational\nmethods to solve integrated assessment models of climate\nchange and theoretical economic models, such as dynamic\ncontracts.\nMy research focuses on how to improve\neffectiveness of climate policy at both micro and macro\nlevels. In particular, I am interested in building relevant\nclimate-economy models that analyze the interaction between\neconomies and the climate under risks arising from (1) climate change\nand (2) a transition to carbon-neutral economies.\nAs an economics and data science teacher, my goal is\nto equip students with the essential tools of machine learning,\neconometrics, and data science to think critically about\nbusiness and real-world socioeconomic issues. As an instructor,\nI let students use those tools to deal with important business\nstrategies, social issues, and individual decision-making.\nHere is my curriculum vitae\n.\nHere is my teaching website\n.\n\nLast updated: 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Position\n\n2021 — present\n\n\nLecturer in Data AnalyticsSchool\nof Business, SUNY Geneseo\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n2016 — 2021\n\n\nPh.D. in Economics, University of\nWyomingSupervisors: Chuck Mason and Thorsten JanusMentors: Stephen Newbold and Jay ShogrenDissertaion: Essays in Political\nEconomy of Climate Change\n\n\n2014 — 2015\n\n\nM.Sc. in Economics, Arizona State\nUniversity\n\n2012 — 2014\n\n\nM.A. in Economics, SUNY Stony\nBrook\n\n2006 — 2012\n\n\nB.Sc. in Applied Mathematics,\nHanyang University at Ansan, South Korea\n\n2006 — 2012\n\n\nB.A. in Economics, Hanyang\nUniversity at Ansan, South Korea\n\n\n\nResearch\n\nWorking papers\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from\n#climatechange/#globalwarming and Energy Lobbies\n  Abstract: To what extent do social media campaigns\ncompete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation? In this\narticle, I estimate the effect of social media campaigns on a\ncongressperson’s legislative activities against climate change actions\nduring the U.S. Congresses (January 2013-January 2019). I find that (1)\na 1% increase in the per-capita level of activities of climate change\ncampaigns using Twitter decreases Democrats’ tendency to support\nclimate-unfriendly legislation by 0.9%, while it increases Republicans’\none by 0.2%; and (2) a 1% increase in the fossil fuel industry’s\nlobbying expenditure relative to the rest of industries’ lobbying\nexpenditure increases Republicans’ tendency to support\nclimate-unfriendly legislation by 1.1%. I also find that negative\nsentiment in social media campaigns contributes to affecting\ncongresspersons’ support for climate-unfriendly legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Finance under Conflicts and Renegotiations: A Dynamic Contract\nApproach   \n\n(AEA 2019 poster)\n Abstract: Considering climate funds (e.g. the Green\nClimate Fund) as the financial mechanism to provide funding to\ndeveloping countries, this paper examines a long-term climate funding\nrelationship between two agents—the rich country and the poor country.\nConflicts between the rich and poor countries arise when determining 1)\nthe size of climate funding that the rich country contributes to the\npoor country, and 2) the funding allocation between climate adaptation\nand mitigation projects in the poor country. In addition, the rich\ncountry cannot be forced to commit contractual contributions to the poor\ncountry, and the climate funding relationship can be repeatedly\nrenegotiated. This paper derives the following results: (1) climate\nfunds converge to the first-best in the long-run, in terms of the size\nof climate funding and its balance between adaptation and mitigation\nprojects, if and only if climate damage becomes sufficiently severe. (2)\nfunding allocation between adaptation and mitigation projects becomes\nmore favorable to the poor country if marginal climate costs in the poor\ncountry grow faster than in the rich country. (3) fewer conflicts and\nfewer renegotiations between the rich and poor countries make climate\nfunding contracts more efficient, remedying inequality between the poor\nand rich countries.\n\n\n\n\nWork in progress\n\n\n\n Hiding Behind a Small Cake’ in an\nOnline Dictator Game: The Way You Hide Matters!, (with Tabare Capitan\n(1st author) , Jason Shogren, and Benjamin White) Abstract: Using an online dictator game in which\nreceivers have incomplete information of the size of the endowment (big\nor small), the article, ‘’Hiding behind a small cake’ in a newspaper\ndictator game (Ockenfels and Werner (2012))’’ shows that a few givers\nwho received the big endowment use their giving to signal they received\nthe small endowment (i.e., to lie). In other words, even though a giver\nwill never meet the corresponding receiver, he cares enough about how he\ncould be perceived by others to lie (i.e., second-order beliefs enters\nhis utility function). In our experiment we provide givers with the\nopportunity to lie about the size of the endowment without using their\ngiving. Similar to Ockenfels and Werner (2012) we find that (i) few take\nthe opportunity to lie—but those who do give less when their giving is\nnot constrained by its role as a signal—and (ii) givers are more likely\nto lie when the lie is private. However, using a second stage in the\nexperimental design, we show that liars are the most responsive group of\ngivers to a simple message stating the expectation of the receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n2022\n\n\n Instructor, DANL 399: Data Analytics\nCapstone  SUNY GeneseoAdvised\nstudents’ research project that integrates the technical data analytic\nskills and critical analysis on a business/economics topic\n\n\n2022\n\n\n Instructor, DANL 310: Data\nVisualization and Presentation  SUNY\nGeneseoTaught for data visualization and reproducible paper writing\non the web.\n\n\n2021\n\n\n Instructor, DANL 300: Advanced Data\nAnalytics  SUNY GeneseoTaught for\nmachine learning methods (classification, regularized regression, random\nforest, clustering, association rules) using business and economics\napplications\n\n\n2021 — 2022\n\n\n Instructor, DANL 210: Data Preparation\nand Management  SUNY GeneseoTaught\nthe tidyverse R package, Python Selenium, Web API, and Google Clouds\n\n\n2021 — 2022\n\n\n Instructor, DANL 200: Introduction to\nData Analytics  SUNY GeneseoTaught\nfor basices in machine learning methods using business and economics\napplications\n\n\n2018\n\n\n Instructor, ECON 3010: Intermediate\nMacroeconomics  University of\nWyomingTaught (1) the concept of GDP, (2) the causes of economic\ngrowth and inequality, (3) how goods, labor, and credit markets work,\n(4) the role of the Fed and the monetary system, (5) the theory and\npolicymaking for short-run economic fluctuations, (6) the influence of\ninternational trade and international finance on the domestic economy\n\n\n\n\nProfessional activities\n\nPresentations\n\n2022\n\n\nInterdisciplinary Data Science\nWorkshop, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah\n\n\n2021\n\n\nOnline Seminar, Department of\nEnvironmental and Business Economics, University of Southern Denmark\n\n\n2019\n\n\nUniversity of Wyoming & Colorado State\nUniversity Economics Graduate Student Symposium, Laramie, Wyoming\n\n\n2019\n\n\nAmerican Economic Association Annual\nMeeting (poster session),, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\n2018\n\n\nThe 29th International Conference on Game\nTheory, Stony Brook, New York\n\n\n\n\nMemberships\n\n2018 — present\n\n\nAssociation of Environmental and Resource\nEconomists\n\n\n2017 — present\n\n\nAmerican Economic Association\n\n\n2017 — 2019\n\n\nEconometric Society\n\n\n\n\n\nHornors & Awards\n\n2022\n\n\nHonorable Mention, Advising the SUNY\nGeneseo team for the Business Analytics Competition, Manhattan\nCollege\n\n\n2019\n\n\nH.
